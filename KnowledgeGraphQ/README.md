# Knowledge Graph & Semantic Search Service

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph & Semantic Search Service provides a centralized, continuously updated knowledge graph that integrates both structured and unstructured data sources from across your organization. It exposes powerful semantic search APIs for agents, LLMs, and downstream applications, enabling context-rich, intelligent retrieval and reasoning.

## Key Features

- **Unified Knowledge Graph:** Seamlessly integrates databases, documents, APIs, ontologies, and real-time streams.
- **Continuous Ingestion:** Automated pipelines keep the graph up-to-date with new and changing data.
- **Entity & Relationship Extraction:** NLP pipelines extract and maintain rich semantic links from text and structured records.
- **Semantic Search APIs:** Expose REST/GraphQL endpoints for concept-based, fuzzy, and contextual queries.
- **Access Control & Auditing:** Fine-grained permissions and full query/audit logging.
- **Customizable Ontologies:** Supports domain-specific schema extension and entity types.
- **Integration-Ready:** Designed to power LLM-based agents, question answering, recommendation, and analytics.

## Example Use Cases

- AgentQ context enrichment and reasoning
- Organizational Q&A and expert finding
- Real-time compliance and risk analysis
- Recommendation and personalization engines

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies** and configure your data connectors.
2. **Start the ingestion pipeline** with your data sources.
3. **Launch the Knowledge Graph service.**
4. **Query via REST/GraphQL** for entities, relationships, and semantic matches.
