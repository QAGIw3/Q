# Agent Simulation & Sandbox Environment

## Overview

The Agent Simulation & Sandbox Environment is a safe, isolated platform for simulating and testing agentQ and managerQ behaviors before deploying them into production. It supports scenario scripting, performance monitoring, and interactive debugging to ensure reliability and safety.

## Key Features

- **Scenario Scripting:** Define complex, multi-agent scenarios with environmental parameters and event triggers.
- **Behavioral Observation:** Monitor agent actions, communications, and decision-making in real time.
- **Performance Metrics:** Collect latency, resource usage, inference quality, and safety compliance stats.
- **Rollback & Replay:** Save, pause, and replay simulation runs for in-depth analysis.
- **Isolation:** Full separation from production data and systems, preventing side-effects.
- **Integration Hooks:** Simulate external systems, APIs, and user behaviors for end-to-end testing.

## Example Use Cases

- Stress-testing agent swarms under failure or attack scenarios
- Validating prompt templates, skills, and policy changes
- Safety and compliance certification
- Training and debugging agentQ/managerQ logic

## Quick Start

1. **Install the simulation environment** and dependencies.
2. **Write your scenario scripts** using provided templates.
3. **Launch the simulation** and monitor results via the dashboard or CLI.
4. **Analyze metrics and refine agent behaviors.**

## Documentation

See `/docs` for scripting reference, metrics schema, and advanced simulation features.

## Contributing

Suggestions for new scenario modules, monitoring plugins, and UI tools are welcome! See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.



# Cross-Platform Integration Hub

## Overview

The Cross-Platform Integration Hub is a plug-and-play service for connecting your AI ecosystem to external APIs, databases, SaaS, and messaging platforms (such as Slack, Teams, SAP, and more). It features a no-code/low-code interface, enabling rapid, secure integration with minimal effort.

## Key Features

- **Connector Marketplace:** Prebuilt and community-contributed connectors for popular services and data sources.
- **No-Code/Low-Code Designer:** Visual interface for building integration flows, data mappings, and event-driven automations.
- **Secure Credential Management:** Vault-based secrets storage and role-based access control.
- **Event & Data Transformation:** Built-in tools for filtering, transforming, and mapping data between systems.
- **Scheduling & Triggers:** Time-based, event-based, and API-driven integration triggers.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Real-time dashboards and alerting for integration health and failures.
- **Extensible SDK:** Build custom connectors, actions, and workflows in your preferred language.

## Example Use Cases

- Syncing agentQ actions with enterprise calendars, CRMs, or ticketing systems
- Integrating LLM-powered assistants into chat and collaboration platforms
- Orchestrating data flows between cloud and on-premise applications
- Automating business processes with AI-driven triggers

## Quick Start

1. **Deploy the Integration Hub** and install desired connectors.
2. **Design integration flows** using the visual designer or YAML/JSON configs.
3. **Configure credentials and permissions** for target systems.
4. **Monitor and manage integrations** via the dashboard or API.

## Documentation

API guides, connector templates, and integration recipes are available in the `/docs` directory.

## Contributing

We welcome new connectors, integrations, and UI/UX improvements. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.
