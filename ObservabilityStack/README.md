# Observability Stack

## Overview

This service provides a centralized system for collecting, storing, and analyzing metrics, logs, and traces from every component in the Q Platform. A unified observability stack is non-negotiable for operating, debugging, and optimizing a complex, distributed system.

## Key Components

| Component     | Technology                                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Metrics**   | [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)      | The industry standard for time-series metrics collection and alerting. All services will expose a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus to scrape.                       |
| **Logging**   | [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/)         | A highly-scalable, cost-effective log aggregation system designed to work seamlessly with Prometheus labels. Services should emit structured (JSON) logs.          |
| **Tracing**   | [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/)       | A high-volume distributed tracing backend. It integrates with OpenTelemetry to ingest traces, allowing for detailed performance analysis across service calls.   |
| **Visualization** | [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)           | The single pane of glass for observability. It will be used to create dashboards that correlate metrics (Prometheus), logs (Loki), and traces (Tempo) in one place. |

## Integration Strategy

1.  **Instrumentation**: All microservices (`H2M`, `agentQ`, `managerQ`, etc.) will be instrumented using OpenTelemetry SDKs. This provides a single, vendor-neutral way to export metrics, logs, and traces.
2.  **Collection**: The Terraform configuration will be updated to deploy the Helm charts for Prometheus, Loki, and Tempo.
3.  **Visualization**: Pre-built Grafana dashboards will be provisioned to monitor key application and infrastructure KPIs.

## Roadmap

- Deploy Helm charts for the full stack.
- Create standardized Grafana dashboards for each microservice.
- Implement an alerting strategy using Prometheus Alertmanager.
- Integrate with `AuthQ` to secure dashboard access.
