## üîç Overview

QuantumPulse is a scalable, resilient, and intelligent platform for deploying large‚Äëlanguage models (LLMs) in real time. Leveraging Apache Pulsar‚Äôs robust messaging and streaming capabilities, QuantumPulse provides:

- **High-throughput inference request queuing**
- **Dynamic model shard routing and load balancing**
- **Real-time prompt optimization and preprocessing**
- **Continuous model updates and hot swapping**
- **Feedback loops for RLHF**
- **Edge-to-core hybrid deployments**
- **Streaming analytics and observability**

---

## üìå Who Is This For?

QuantumPulse is designed for:

- AI/ML engineers working with LLMs in production  
- Data infrastructure teams integrating real-time generative AI  
- Organizations scaling conversational agents, chatbots, or autonomous systems

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

1. **Distributed Inference Queue**  
   Partitioned Pulsar topics and Pulsar Functions enable scalable LLM inference.

2. **Shard-aware Routing**  
   Model shards are load-balanced via topic partitioning and subscription logic.

3. **Prompt Optimization**  
   Clean, tokenize, and filter prompts on the fly using Pulsar Streams.

4. **Streaming Model Rollouts**  
   Distribute model weight updates to workers in real time with schema-validated streams.

5. **RLHF Feedback Loop**  
   Capture user corrections, stream them back into training data pipelines.

6. **Adaptive Scaling**  
   Integrate with Flink or Pulsar SQL to anticipate load and auto-scale Kubernetes infra.

7. **Edge-Cloud Hybrid**  
   Deploy lightweight inference at the edge and route heavylift tasks to the core.

8. **Vector Embedding Streams**  
   Real-time embedding ingestion to vector DBs like Milvus or Pinecone.

9. **Ensemble & Ensemble Merging**  
   Combine outputs from multiple LLMs and orchestrate them through Pulsar.

10. **Persistent Memory**  
    Store conversation contexts in Pulsar for context-aware follow‚Äëups.

11. **Token-Level Analytics**  
    Stream token-level events for drift detection, latency insights, and cost analysis.

12. **Autonomous Agent Collaboration**  
    Orchestrate agent interactions via topic-based messaging.

13. **Prompt Marketplace**  
    Share and reuse prompt templates safely via Pulsar multi-tenancy.

14. **Distributed Model Recombination:** Break LLMs into modular "skills" that can be recombined dynamically into customized, task-specific inference models. Provides just-in-time customized model assembly from a skill library.

## üì¶ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following components are installed:

- Apache Pulsar (‚â•‚ÄØ2.11)
- Kubernetes & Helm (for infra deployment)
- GPUs or GPU nodes for inference workloads

### Installation

1. Deploy Pulsar (local or cloud), including brokers, bookies, and schema registry.
   ```bash
   helm install pulsar apache/pulsar
