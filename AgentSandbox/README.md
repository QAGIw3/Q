# Agent Simulation & Sandbox Environment

## Overview

The Agent Simulation & Sandbox Environment is a safe, isolated platform for simulating and testing agentQ and managerQ behaviors before deploying them into production. It supports scenario scripting, performance monitoring, and interactive debugging to ensure reliability and safety.

## Key Features

- **Scenario Scripting:** Define complex, multi-agent scenarios with environmental parameters and event triggers.
- **Behavioral Observation:** Monitor agent actions, communications, and decision-making in real time.
- **Performance Metrics:** Collect latency, resource usage, inference quality, and safety compliance stats.
- **Rollback & Replay:** Save, pause, and replay simulation runs for in-depth analysis.
- **Isolation:** Full separation from production data and systems, preventing side-effects.
- **Integration Hooks:** Simulate external systems, APIs, and user behaviors for end-to-end testing.

## Example Use Cases

- Stress-testing agent swarms under failure or attack scenarios
- Validating prompt templates, skills, and policy changes
- Safety and compliance certification
- Training and debugging agentQ/managerQ logic

## Quick Start

1. **Install the simulation environment** and dependencies.
2. **Write your scenario scripts** using provided templates.
3. **Launch the simulation** and monitor results via the dashboard or CLI.
4. **Analyze metrics and refine agent behaviors.**

## Documentation

See `/docs` for scripting reference, metrics schema, and advanced simulation features.

## Observability

-   **Structured Logging**: The service and its background threads use `structlog` to emit JSON-formatted logs. Logs from scenario runs are tagged with a unique `simulation_id` for easy correlation.
-   **Metrics**: The main API server exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus to scrape.
