# QuantumPulse Collaborative Manager (QP-Manager)

## Overview

QuantumPulse Collaborative Manager (QP-Manager) is the orchestration backbone for coordinating a swarm of distributed QP-Agents. Designed to facilitate real-time collaborative decision-making, federated instruction tuning, and emergent behavior discovery, QP-Manager enables resource-aware scaling and dynamic load balancing within a highly distributed AI ecosystem.

## Key Responsibilities

* **Swarm Coordination & Orchestration**: Manage and synchronize distributed QP-Agents across geographies.
* **Federated Learning & Tuning**: Secure, privacy-preserving instruction tuning leveraging federated learning techniques.
* **Real-Time Collaboration**: Orchestrate on-the-fly strategy optimization and decision-making.
* **Emergent Behavior Discovery**: Identify, analyze, and disseminate newly discovered strategies and behaviors.
* **Resource-Aware Management**: Dynamically scale agents based on compute and energy availability.

## Components

### 1. Swarm Intelligence Coordinator

* Pulsar-based topic communication channels
* Real-time agent collaboration management

### 2. Federated Learning Module

* Secure distributed tuning of agent instruction sets
* Skill and instruction optimization across the swarm

### 3. Resource Scheduling Manager

* Adaptive load balancing and scaling of QP-Agents
* Energy-aware task allocation

### 4. Emergent Behavior Analyzer

* Detection and analysis of novel emergent strategies
* Continuous distribution of learned behaviors back into the swarm

## Technical Stack

| Component                      | Technology           |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Messaging & Geo-Replication    | Apache Pulsar        |
| Event-Driven Analytics         | Apache Flink         |
| Container Orchestration        | Kubernetes           |
| Vector Storage & Skill Sharing | Milvus (or similar)  |
| Observability & Metrics        | Prometheus / Grafana |

## Use Cases

* **Multi-Agent Problem Solving**: Complex financial modeling, logistics optimization.
* **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Governance and decision workflows.
* **Crisis Management**: Coordinated disaster response and resource allocation.
* **Distributed AI Workforce**: Large-scale AI task delegation and management.

## Installation & Deployment

1. **Cluster Setup**

   * Provision a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., via `kubeadm`, managed cloud service).
   * Ensure Apache Pulsar and Flink clusters are deployed (Helm charts recommended).

2. **Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   export PULSAR_SERVICE_URL=pulsar://<pulsar-broker>:6650
   export FLINK_JOB_MANAGER_URL=http://<flink-jobmanager>:8081
   export MILVUS_HOST=<milvus-host>
   ```

3. **Deploy QP-Manager**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/qp-manager-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/qp-manager-service.yaml
   ```

4. **Monitoring**

   * Access Grafana dashboard at `http://<grafana-host>:3000`.
   * Query Prometheus metrics under `qp_manager_*` namespace.

## Usage

* **Swarm Initialization**: Trigger the initial agent registration via the QP-Manager API endpoint:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<qp-manager>:8080/api/v1/swarm/register -d '{ "agentId": "agent-001" }'
  ```

* **Tuning Round**: Start a federated learning round:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<qp-manager>:8080/api/v1/tuning/start
  ```

* **Behavior Analysis**: Fetch emergent behavior reports:

  ```bash
  curl http://<qp-manager>:8080/api/v1/behaviors/latest
  ```
